This repository contains the initial setup and structure for a Flutter application, ready for further customization and feature implementation.

## Features
- Cross-platform support for iOS and Android
- Basic Flutter project structure
- Scalable architecture for adding chat functionalities
- Easy-to-extend codebase for future development

## Project Structure
Below is the basic structure of the Shadow Talk Flutter project:

```
Shadow_Talk/
├── android/                # Android-specific files and configurations
├── ios/                    # iOS-specific files and configurations
├── lib/                    # Main Flutter source code
│   ├── main.dart           # Entry point of the application
│   └── (other Dart files)  # Additional Dart files for widgets, screens, etc.
├── test/                   # Unit and widget tests
├── pubspec.yaml            # Project dependencies and metadata
├── README.md               # Project documentation (this file)
└── (other configuration files)  # e.g., .gitignore, analysis_options.yaml
```

- **android/**: Contains Android-specific configurations, such as the app's manifest and build.gradle files.
- **ios/**: Contains iOS-specific configurations, including Info.plist and Xcode project files.
- **lib/**: The core of the Flutter app, where Dart code resides. `main.dart` is the entry point.
- **test/**: Directory for writing unit and widget tests.
- **pubspec.yaml**: Defines the project's dependencies, assets, and metadata.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.0.0 or higher)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (included with Flutter)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- An emulator or physical device for testing

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashjain329/Shadow_Talk.git
   cd Shadow_Talk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   Ensure an emulator or device is connected. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started).

## Usage
After running the app, you can explore the basic Flutter project structure. The app currently provides a starting point for a Flutter application. To customize or add features:
- Modify the `lib/main.dart` file to update the app's entry point.
- Add new widgets, screens, or packages to extend functionality.
- Integrate backend services (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) for real-time chat features.

For additional guidance, check the [Flutter online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which includes tutorials, samples, and API references.
